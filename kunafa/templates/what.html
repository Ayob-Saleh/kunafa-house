	<p>What is Kunafa?</p>
	<p>Kunafa, whose name is derived from the Arabic verb kanaf (to shelter), dates back at least half a millenium, with conflicting reports placing its origin in the West Bank city of Nablus in the 10th century or 15th century. According to some reports, knafeh was first created for Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan, the 10th Century first Caliph of the Umayyad Empire, centered in Damascus, in order to eat during suhoor as a surefire way to stave off hunger during the day-long fast. Other reports, carrying the same story of a king struggling with a voracious appetite in Ramadan, trace the origins of knafeh to the 15th Century Fatimid Empire, centered in Cairo, under Caliph Abdelmalik bin Marwan. Still other reports claim that knafeh is derived from katayef, which is another popular Arab dish, whose origins lie in 13th Century Baghdad. While its origins are difficult to pinpoint, knafeh today is both a staple of Arab and Palestinian cuisine and emblematic of Palestinian perseverance, culture, and pride.</p>

 

	<p>Kunafa is a sugar-soaked pastry that is common in a number of Arabic countries and territories, especially during Ramadan. Though the exact preparation and the spelling of the name varies by region, most kunafa are layered or filled with either cheese (anything from goat cheese to soft regional cheeses) or cream, soaked in a sugar syrup flavored with rose water or orange blossom water, and then topped with ground nuts like pistachios.</p>
